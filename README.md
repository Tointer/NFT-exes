# NFT Exes

## Let's put more "NF" in NFT

This project aims to bring more attention to individual NFT history to make them more distinguishable even inside their own collection.

## How it works

You can enter your address to see all past owners of your NFTs and how long they was holding it. Addresses of some people would be highlighted with certain color. Famous people, such as Beeple and Vitalik, would be highlighted with blue, while any punk or BAYC holder would be highlited with amber. In the future there would be more categories for better navigation

if you want to see this project in it's full glory, you can use 0x367dc97068ab54ba1dfbfc0fad12fbcb7b3a0d09 address as input
